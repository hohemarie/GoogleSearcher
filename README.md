# GoogleSearch

The aim of the program is when the user types "ruby google_searcher.rb how to center a div" in a terminal, the latter launches a Google Search with what the user filled in.

The user enters an ARGV at the beginning of the execution of the program.
If the latter does not give any ARGV, the program tells him or her how it works.
The ARGV corresponds to what the user wants to search on Google.
The program goes and gets the ARGV, builds the URL from the ARGV.
Then the program goes and opens a new window from this search.

In this repository, you will find two programs:


-One program that does a Google search (03_google_searcher.rb)



-One program that created a full Ruby file (02_creation_file.rb)



The first file (01_recherche_google.rb) that you will find is an application of the lesson.
